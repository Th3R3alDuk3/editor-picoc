# pico-OCI

pico - `O`nline `C` `I`nterpreter  
  
This is an online **C-editor** that uses a **client side C-interpreter** recompiled to WASM.  
  
The project was equipped with some useful plugins such as [picoc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picoc-js) or the [Monaco-Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) from Microsoft.  
We use the [picoc interpreter](https://gitlab.com/zsaleeba/picoc) from Zik Saleeba because it is best suited for our purposes.  
  
Feel free to use a different interpreter or programming language. You hardly have to change anything!
