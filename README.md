# editor-picoc
  
This is an online **C-editor** that uses a **client-side C-interpreter**.  
  
In this project some great modules like [picoc-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/picoc-js) or [monaco-editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) were used.  
Because it is small and suitable for our requirements, we opted for the [picoc](https://gitlab.com/zsaleeba/picoc) interpreter from *Zik Saleeba*.  
Special thanks to *Krithik Rao* for recompiling [picoc](https://gitlab.com/zsaleeba/picoc) to WASM. 
  
Feel free to use a different interpreter or programming language. You hardly have to change anything!
